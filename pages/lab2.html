        <h1>Studying Advice</h1>
        <p>Much of the advice people give about studying is wrong.</p>
        <p>Always study in the same place?</p>
        <p class="wrong">Wrong!</p>
        <p>Study one topic intensively before going on to the next?</p>
        <p class="wrong">Wrong!</p>
        <p>Here are some study tips that are based on <strong>actual research</strong>.</p>
        <p class="attribution">From <span class="title">Forget What You Know About Good Study Habits</span>, by Benedict
            Carey, published in the <span class="title">New York Times</span> on September 6, 2010.</p>
        <h2>Alternate study environments</h2>
        <p>Study in the library, in the coffee shop, in your room, ... Varying the place you study helps you remember
            more.</p>
        <h2>Mix Content</h2>
        <p>Study a bit of this, a bit of that, some of this again, some of the other. Switching content helps you
            remember more.</p>
        <h2>Space study sessions</h2>
        <p>Three one-hour sessions are more effective than one three-hour session.</p>
        <h2>Self-testing</h2>
        <p>Test yourself, or have a buddy do it. It helps you know how well you know.</p>
        <p>CoreDogs is good at this. That's what the review system is for.</p>
